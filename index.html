<!-- Defined constants for the warning messages to improve readability and maintainability.
Declared all the variables and initialized them with appropriate values.
Used proper comparison operators (e.g., === instead of =) in the conditional statements.
Fixed the syntax errors (e.g., closing curly braces).
Changed the NONE_SELECTED value to 0 to reflect its intended use.
Used let instead of const for the location and currency variables to allow them to be updated later in the code.
Added a variable shippingCost to hold the calculated shipping cost based on the user's location.
Changed the shipping variable to initially be null instead of 0 to avoid confusion later in the code.
Removed the unnecessary calcShipping in the if statement.
Added a check to handle the case where the user is from North Korea and cannot be shipped to.
Used subtotal variable to calculate the total cost before adding the shipping cost.
Used a single if-else chain to handle the different shipping costs based on the user's location.
Moved the check for free shipping inside the check for the user's location to avoid unnecessary calculations.
Changed the check for customers to be inside the check for location to avoid referencing a variable that was not defined yet. -->
